SAP's recent announcement of a strategic partnership with Databricks has sparked considerable enthusiasm within the SAP customer community.

Given the tremendous interest surrounding this collaborative effort, we are excited to unveil this demonstration, showcasing the seamless integration of SAP data with Databricks.

SAP has recently introduced its next-generation Data Warehouse cloud, named SAP Datasphere, which is poised to become the central hub of the SAP ecosystem. This platform will consolidate data from vital systems such as SAP S/4HANA and BW4/HANA.

The integration of data from SAP Datasphere with Databricks is facilitated through the use of SAP Federated ML Python libraries (FedML), which can be effortlessly installed from the PyPi repository. One of the standout features of SAP FedML is its native compatibility with Databricks. This compatibility enables the utilization of methods like execute_query_pyspark('query'), allowing for the execution of SQL queries and the retrieval of data in the form of a PySpark DataFrame, streamlining data analysis and manipulation.
